## What is Stamp Network?

Stamp is a layer of composable attestations on top of EAS that helps communities understand their members and collaborate, using Zupass as an interoperability & privacy layer.&#x20;

## What is an attestation?

An **attestation** refers to a signed statement or proof provided by an entity (usually a user or a smart contract) regarding a specific date or event. In decentralized systems like Ethereum, attestations can be used to validate or confirm facts or actions in a trustless manner, without the need for intermediaries.

## Use Cases

These layers of attestations can take many forms, from creating a web of trust to endorsements for people's skills and capabilities for organizations or AI agents.

## Credentials

There are \***tickets\***, which are acquired when purchasing a ticket. These do not necessarily imply trust.

Users can vouch for each other through **\*stamps\***, which are attestations and can be revoked.&#x20;

When a user gets a high trust score, by collecting stamps from other users, a **\*passport\*** is emitted. Each community can define a different threshold that lets users obtain there. Depending on the trust required to safeguard the community, this can be higher or lower.&#x20;
