## What is an attestation?

An **attestation** refers to a signed statement or proof provided by an entity (usually a user or a smart contract) regarding a specific date or event. In decentralized systems like Ethereum, attestations can be used to validate or confirm facts or actions in a trustless manner, without the need for intermediaries.

## Use Cases

These layers of attestations can take many forms, from creating a web of trust to endorsements for people's skills and capabilities for organizations or AI agents.
