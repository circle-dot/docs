# Verify Credentials

This tutorial will teach you how to verify a user's credentials. This can be used as a login system, gating mechanism, or one-time redemption. \
\
Stamp Passports are PODs (Provable Object Data) that can be verified while maintaining different levels of an account's privacy.&#x20;

### Privacy

When you verify a passport, you must define which fields the user must disclose. Each proof from a POD comes with a nullifier parameter, which is unique and can be used to do single-use verification while maintaining the user's privacy.&#x20;

### Verification Code
