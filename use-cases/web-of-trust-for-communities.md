# Web of Trust for Communities

A **Web of Trust (WoT)** is a decentralized trust model where users establish trust relationships by directly verifying each otherâ€™s identities, or by relying on other trusted users to do so. It is based on peer-to-peer trust rather than a hierarchical structure (like certificate authorities in Public Key Infrastructure, PKI).

## Credentials

There are \***tickets\***, which are acquired when purchasing a ticket. These do not necessarily imply trust.

Users can vouch for each other through **\*stamps\***, which are attestations and can be revoked.&#x20;

When a user gets a high trust score, by collecting stamps from other users, a **\*passport\*** is emitted. Each community can define a different threshold that lets users obtain there. Depending on the trust required to safeguard the community, this can be higher or lower.&#x20;
