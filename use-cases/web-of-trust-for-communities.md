# Web of Trust for Communities

A **Web of Trust (WoT)** is a decentralized trust model where users establish trust relationships by directly verifying each otherâ€™s identities, or by relying on other trusted users to do so. It is based on peer-to-peer trust rather than a hierarchical structure (like certificate authorities in Public Key Infrastructure, PKI).
